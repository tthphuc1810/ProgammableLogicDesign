# Verilog Code Programming for Logic Circuit Design

## Introduction

* This project is used as a final assignment for the Programmable Logic Design course.
* The project is built on the principles of logic gates using Verilog code.
* The project requirements include:
  - Designing an 8-to-1 MUX circuit.
  - Designing a LED shift circuit using 10 red LEDs, controlled by SW0 and KEY0.
  - Designing a timer circuit that counts minutes and seconds, displayed on HEX3, HEX2, HEX1, HEX0, and controlled by the keys on the FPGA DE10 board.

### Supervisor

* Dr. Le Duc Hung - Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Science - VNU-HCM
